Endpoint to search for parks by:

/search?radius=50&startingLat=40&startingLon=40&keyword=kayaking&direction=west

/query-by-radius lat, long, radius
/query-by-travel-time - potentially not MVP worthy
/query-by-direction type (west/east or north/south), current (lat/long)

/query-by-state state abbreviates
/query-by-name - name
/query-by-keyword - search in description
/query-by-activity - search in linked activities for park

How do we determine radius? Driving distance vs time distance? Coordinates?
for parks in multiple states, add the other states to the addresses
edge case? Driving to hawaii?

TODO: Add activities or features to park? //
activities, tags, and keywords
keywords search the description
activities and tags are tables that we link to the park
